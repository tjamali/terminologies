## **FOUNDATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY**

### **Nucleotide**
The basic building block of DNA and RNA, consisting of a phosphate group, a sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA), and one of four nitrogenous bases (A, T, G, C in DNA; A, U, G, C in RNA).

### **Base pairs**
Complementary nucleotides that pair together in double-stranded DNA (A with T, G with C) or RNA-DNA hybrids. The human genome contains approximately 3.2 billion base pairs.

### **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)**
**DNA** is the stable, double-stranded hereditary material that stores genetic information in all living organisms and many viruses, composed of two antiparallel strands forming a double helix structure where each strand consists of deoxyribonucleotides containing deoxyribose sugar, phosphate groups, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine) that pair specifically through hydrogen bonds (A-T and G-C). The double helix structure, discovered by Watson and Crick, provides both stability for long-term information storage and a mechanism for accurate replication through **semiconservative DNA replication**, where each strand serves as a template for synthesizing a complementary strand. DNA organization ranges from the molecular level (nucleotide sequences encoding genes, regulatory elements, and non-coding regions) to higher-order structures (chromosomes, chromatin), with the human genome containing approximately 3.2 billion base pairs encoding ~20,000-25,000 genes along with vast amounts of regulatory sequences, repetitive elements, and intergenic regions. Key DNA processes include **replication** (copying genetic information for cell division), **transcription** (producing RNA copies of genes), **recombination** (genetic exchange during meiosis), and **repair mechanisms** (maintaining genomic integrity), while DNA modifications such as **methylation** provide epigenetic regulation of gene expression without changing the underlying sequence, making DNA both a stable repository of genetic information and a dynamic platform for cellular regulation.

### **RNA (Ribonucleic acid)**
**RNA** is a versatile nucleic acid that differs from DNA in several key ways: it contains ribose sugar (with a 2'-OH group) instead of deoxyribose, uses uracil instead of thymine, and is typically single-stranded, allowing it to fold into complex 3D structures. This structural flexibility enables RNA to perform diverse functions beyond simple information storage, including catalysis (ribozymes), regulation, and protein synthesis. The presence of the 2'-OH group makes RNA less stable than DNA but allows for the formation of intricate secondary structures that are essential for its various biological roles.

The major types of RNA include **mRNA (messenger RNA)**, which carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis; **tRNA (transfer RNA)**, which brings amino acids to the ribosome during translation; **rRNA (ribosomal RNA)**, the structural and catalytic component of ribosomes; and various **regulatory RNAs** such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that control gene expression, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that regulate chromatin and transcription, and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that process other RNAs. Additionally, newer discoveries include circular RNAs (circRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), highlighting the expanding complexity of the RNA world and its central role in gene regulation and cellular function.

### **Gene**
**Gene structure and organization** is more complex than a simple definition. A typical eukaryotic gene consists of **regulatory sequences** (promoters, enhancers, silencers) that control when and where the gene is expressed, **exons** (coding sequences that appear in mature mRNA), **introns** (non-coding sequences removed during RNA processing), and **untranslated regions (UTRs)** that influence mRNA stability and translation. The **promoter region** contains binding sites for transcription factors and RNA polymerase, while **enhancers** can be located thousands of base pairs away and still influence gene expression through DNA looping. Additionally, genes can have **alternative start sites**, **alternative splicing patterns**, and **alternative polyadenylation sites**, allowing a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms with different functions, expression patterns, or regulatory properties.

**Gene expression and regulation** involves multiple interconnected steps that can be controlled at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. **Transcriptional regulation** involves transcription factors, chromatin modifications (histone acetylation, methylation), DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling complexes that determine whether a gene is turned on or off. **Post-transcriptional regulation** includes alternative splicing, microRNA-mediated silencing, RNA editing, and mRNA stability control through 3' UTR elements. The concept of **gene expression** encompasses the entire process from DNA transcription to functional protein production, and this process is highly dynamic, responding to developmental cues, environmental stimuli, and cellular stress. Modern genomics has revealed that gene regulation is even more complex, involving **long-range chromatin interactions**, **topologically associating domains (TADs)**, and **enhancer-promoter loops** that create regulatory networks influencing multiple genes simultaneously.

### **Chromosome**
**Chromosome structure and organization** involves multiple levels of DNA packaging that enable meters of DNA to fit into microscopic cell nuclei while remaining accessible for cellular processes. DNA is wrapped around **histone proteins** to form **nucleosomes** (the basic repeating unit resembling "beads on a string"), which further condense into **chromatin fibers** through higher-order folding involving histone H1 and chromatin remodeling complexes. Chromosomes exist in different states of compaction: **euchromatin** (loosely packed, transcriptionally active) and **heterochromatin** (tightly packed, transcriptionally silent), with specific regions like **centromeres** (essential for chromosome segregation) and **telomeres** (protective chromosome ends) having specialized chromatin structures. Additionally, chromosomes are organized into **topologically associating domains (TADs)** and occupy distinct **chromosome territories** within the nucleus, creating spatial organization that influences gene expression and regulatory interactions.

**Chromosome function and dynamics** extend far beyond simple gene storage to encompass complex regulatory and organizational roles. Each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of genes arranged in specific patterns, with **gene density**, **repetitive elements**, and **regulatory sequences** varying across chromosomal regions. During cell division, chromosomes undergo dramatic structural changes, condensing into visible X-shaped structures during **metaphase** before being equally distributed to daughter cells, a process requiring precise coordination of **kinetochores**, **spindle fibers**, and **checkpoint mechanisms**. Humans have **23 pairs of chromosomes** (22 pairs of autosomes plus XY or XX sex chromosomes), and chromosomal abnormalities such as **aneuploidy** (incorrect chromosome number), **deletions**, **duplications**, and **translocations** can lead to genetic disorders, cancer, or developmental abnormalities. Modern genomics has revealed that chromosome organization creates **long-range regulatory interactions** where enhancers and promoters separated by millions of base pairs can interact through **chromatin looping**, making chromosome structure a critical determinant of gene expression patterns.

### **Genome**
**Genome** refers to the complete set of genetic material in an organism, encompassing not only all protein-coding genes but also regulatory sequences, non-coding RNAs, repetitive elements, and intergenic regions that together constitute the organism's hereditary blueprint. The human genome contains approximately 3.2 billion base pairs distributed across 23 pairs of chromosomes, with protein-coding sequences representing only ~1-2% of the total genome, while the remaining ~98% includes regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, silencers), introns, repetitive sequences, and vast intergenic regions whose functions are still being discovered. Genome organization varies dramatically across species, with size not directly correlating with organism complexity—a phenomenon known as the **C-value paradox**—while individual human genomes differ by approximately 0.1% (~4-5 million variants), creating the genetic diversity underlying phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. Modern genomics has expanded the concept beyond DNA sequences to include the **epigenome** (DNA methylation and histone modifications), **transcriptome** (all RNA transcripts), and **three-dimensional genome organization**, emphasizing that genome function depends not only on sequence content but also on spatial organization, temporal regulation, and environmental interactions.

## **BASIC GENETICS CONCEPTS**

### **Allele**
**Alleles** are alternative versions of a gene or genetic variant that exist at the same chromosomal location (locus) but differ in their DNA sequence, creating the foundation for genetic diversity within populations and between individuals. In diploid organisms like humans, each individual carries two alleles for every autosomal gene—one inherited from each parent—which can be identical (**homozygous**) or different (**heterozygous**). Alleles can range from single nucleotide differences (like C vs. T at a SNP position) to large structural variations, and they arise through mutations, recombination, and other evolutionary processes. The relationship between alleles determines their expression patterns: **dominant alleles** are expressed when present in just one copy, **recessive alleles** require two copies for expression, while **codominant alleles** both contribute to the phenotype when present together.

The distribution and frequency of alleles in populations form the basis of population genetics and evolutionary biology, with **allele frequencies** changing over time due to natural selection, genetic drift, migration, and mutation. **Major alleles** (most common in a population) and **minor alleles** (less frequent variants) create the genetic variation that underlies individual differences in traits, disease susceptibility, and drug responses. In complex traits, multiple alleles across many genes contribute to phenotypic variation through **additive effects**, **epistatic interactions**, and **gene-environment interactions**. Understanding allelic variation is crucial for medical genetics, as disease-causing alleles may be **penetrant** (always cause disease) or show **variable expressivity** (cause disease with different severity), while **protective alleles** may reduce disease risk, making allelic analysis essential for personalized medicine, genetic counseling, and therapeutic development.

### **Genotype**
An individual's genetic makeup at specific loci, typically described as the combination of alleles present (e.g., CC, CT, or TT for a SNP).

### **Phenotype**
Observable characteristics or traits of an individual, which result from the interaction between genotype and environmental factors (e.g., height, disease status, gene expression levels).

### **Diploid**
Having two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. Humans are diploid organisms with two copies of each chromosome (except sex chromosomes in males).

### **Homozygous**
Having identical alleles at a specific genetic locus (e.g., AA or BB).

### **Heterozygous**
Having different alleles at a specific genetic locus (e.g., AB).

### **Maternal/Paternal**
Referring to genetic material inherited from the mother (maternal) or father (paternal). In diploid organisms, one copy of each chromosome comes from each parent.

## **GENETIC VARIATION CONCEPTS**

### **SNPs (Single nucleotide polymorphisms)**
The most common type of genetic variation among humans, occurring when a single DNA nucleotide (A, T, G, or C) differs between individuals at the same genomic position. SNPs occur approximately once every 300 base pairs throughout the genome. They serve as genetic markers in GWAS and can be functional (affecting protein structure, gene expression) or neutral. Most human genetic diversity is captured by SNPs.

### **Minor allele frequency (MAF)**
The frequency of the less common allele at a genetic variant in a given population. Typically expressed as a proportion or percentage. MAF is crucial for statistical power calculations in association studies—rare variants (low MAF) require larger sample sizes to detect associations. Most GWAS focus on common variants (MAF > 5%) due to power considerations, though rare variant analyses are increasingly important.

### **Genetic loci**
Specific positions or regions on chromosomes where genes or genetic variants are located. A locus (plural: loci) can refer to a single nucleotide position, a gene, or a broader chromosomal region. In GWAS context, it often refers to genomically defined regions containing one or more associated variants that likely represent the same association signal.

## **POPULATION GENETICS CONCEPTS**

### **Population stratification**
Systematic differences in allele frequencies between subgroups within a study population, often due to ancestry or demographic factors. If not properly controlled, it can lead to false positive associations in GWAS because both genetic variants and phenotypes may differ systematically between population subgroups. Corrected using methods like principal component analysis or mixed linear models.

### **Ancestry**
The genetic heritage or lineage of an individual, reflecting the geographic and ethnic origins of their ancestors. Ancestry affects allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns, making it important to consider in genetic studies.

### **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**
A principle stating that allele and genotype frequencies remain constant in a population across generations under certain conditions (no mutation, selection, migration, or non-random mating). Deviations from HWE can indicate technical problems (genotyping errors, population stratification) or biological factors (inbreeding, selection). HWE testing is a standard quality control step in genetic studies.

### **Inbreeding**
Mating between genetically related individuals, which increases the probability of offspring being homozygous for recessive alleles. Can cause deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

### **Selection**
Evolutionary pressure that affects the survival and reproduction of individuals with certain genotypes, potentially altering allele frequencies over time.

## **GENETIC PROCESSES**

### **Recombination**
The process during meiosis where chromosomes exchange genetic material, creating new combinations of alleles. Recombination frequency depends on the physical distance between loci—closer loci recombine less frequently.

### **Linkage disequilibrium**
The non-random association between alleles at different genetic loci. When two variants are in linkage disequilibrium, they are inherited together more often than would be expected by chance. This occurs because loci close together on the same chromosome are less likely to be separated by recombination. LD patterns vary by ancestry and are crucial for GWAS design, as a significant SNP may be tagging the true causal variant rather than being causal itself.

### **Haplotype**
A group of alleles at different loci on the same chromosome that are inherited together as a unit due to linkage disequilibrium. Haplotypes represent the combination of variants along a chromosomal segment and are important for understanding inheritance patterns, population history, and fine-mapping disease associations.

### **Imprinting**
An epigenetic phenomenon where gene expression depends on the parent of origin. Some genes are only expressed from the maternal copy, others only from the paternal copy.

### **Nonsense-mediated decay**
A cellular quality control mechanism that degrades mRNA molecules containing premature stop codons, preventing translation of truncated proteins.

## **REGULATORY CONCEPTS**

### **Cis-regulatory**
Genetic elements or variants that affect the expression of genes on the same chromosome, typically nearby (within ~1Mb). Examples include promoters, enhancers, and cis-eQTLs.

### **Trans-regulatory**
Genetic elements or variants that affect the expression of genes on different chromosomes or distant genes on the same chromosome, typically through diffusible factors like transcription factors.

### **Functional variant**
A genetic variant that has a biological effect, such as changing protein structure, altering gene expression, or affecting regulatory elements.

### **Causal variant**
The actual genetic variant that is biologically responsible for an observed association, as opposed to variants that are associated due to linkage disequilibrium with the causal variant.

### **Risk alleles**
Alleles that increase the probability of developing a disease or trait. In polygenic risk scores, multiple risk alleles are combined to estimate overall genetic risk.

## **STATISTICAL CONCEPTS**

### **Statistical power**
The probability that a study will detect an association if one truly exists. Power depends on effect size, sample size, allele frequency, and significance threshold. Higher power reduces the chance of false negatives.

### **Effect size**
A quantitative measure of the magnitude of a phenomenon, such as how much a genetic variant increases disease risk (odds ratio) or affects a quantitative trait (beta coefficient).

### **Association**
A statistical relationship between two variables, such as between a genetic variant and a phenotype. Association does not necessarily imply causation.

### **Confounding**
A situation where a third variable is associated with both the exposure and outcome, potentially creating a spurious association or masking a true association.

### **Reverse causation**
A situation where the outcome influences the exposure, rather than the exposure causing the outcome. For example, disease status affecting lifestyle factors rather than lifestyle causing disease.

### **Instrumental variables**
Variables that are associated with the exposure but only affect the outcome through their effect on the exposure. Used in Mendelian randomization to infer causal relationships.

### **Principal component analysis (PCA)**
A statistical technique that reduces the dimensionality of data by identifying the main axes of variation. In genetics, used to capture population structure and control for ancestry in association studies.

### **Mixed linear models**
Statistical models that can account for both fixed effects (like covariates) and random effects (like population structure or family relatedness). Commonly used in GWAS to control for confounding.

## **COMPLEX INHERITANCE CONCEPTS**

### **Heritability**
The proportion of phenotypic variation in a population that is attributable to genetic factors. **Narrow-sense heritability (h²)** refers to additive genetic effects only, while **broad-sense heritability (H²)** includes all genetic effects. **SNP heritability** estimates the proportion of trait variation explained by common SNPs captured on genotyping arrays. Heritability is population- and environment-specific.

### **Allelic imbalance**
The unequal expression or representation of two alleles at a heterozygous locus. In diploid organisms, both maternal and paternal alleles should theoretically be expressed equally, but various factors can cause imbalance: cis-regulatory variants, imprinting, nonsense-mediated decay, or technical artifacts. Allelic imbalance analysis in RNA-seq data can identify functional variants affecting gene expression.

## **ADVANCED ANALYTICAL METHODS**

### **GWAS (Genome-wide association studies)**
A research approach that examines genetic variations (typically SNPs) across the entire genome to identify associations with diseases, traits, or phenotypes. GWAS compares the frequency of genetic variants between cases (people with a disease/trait) and controls (people without). It's an unbiased, hypothesis-free method that can discover novel genetic factors. Requires large sample sizes (thousands to millions of individuals) to detect statistically significant associations and account for multiple testing burden.

### **Meta-analysis**
A statistical method that combines results from multiple independent studies to increase statistical power and obtain more precise estimates of genetic effects. In genomics, it pools GWAS data from different cohorts to identify additional genetic loci and improve effect size estimates.

### **Meta-regression**
An extension of meta-analysis that investigates how study-level characteristics (like ancestry, age, sex composition) influence the observed genetic associations. It can identify sources of heterogeneity between studies and explore how genetic effects vary across different populations or conditions.

### **eQTL (Expression quantitative trait loci)**
Genetic variants (usually SNPs) that influence gene expression levels. eQTLs link genetic variation to functional consequences by showing how DNA sequence differences affect RNA expression. **Cis-eQTLs** affect nearby genes (typically within 1Mb), while **trans-eQTLs** affect distant genes or genes on different chromosomes. eQTL analysis helps interpret GWAS findings by identifying the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying genetic associations.

### **Polygenic risk scores (PRS)**
A numerical score that estimates an individual's genetic predisposition to a disease or trait based on their genotype across many genetic variants. PRS is calculated by summing the effects of risk alleles weighted by their effect sizes (typically from GWAS). It represents the cumulative genetic burden and can be used for risk prediction, patient stratification, and understanding genetic architecture of complex traits.

### **Mendelian randomization**
A method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. It leverages the principle that genetic variants are randomly distributed in the population (like random assignment in experiments), helping to overcome confounding and reverse causation issues in observational studies. For example, using genetic variants that affect smoking behavior to determine if smoking causally influences disease risk.
