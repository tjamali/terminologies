# Disease Biology Terms 

## **FUNDAMENTAL DISEASE CONCEPTS**

### **Disease/Disorder**
An abnormal condition that affects the normal functioning of an organism, typically characterized by specific signs, symptoms, or functional impairments. Diseases can be genetic, infectious, environmental, or multifactorial in origin.

### **Pathogenesis**
The biological mechanism by which a disease develops and progresses. Describes the sequence of cellular, molecular, and physiological events that lead from initial cause to manifestation of disease symptoms.

### **Etiology**
The study of disease causation, including the factors and mechanisms that initiate disease development. Can include genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, infections, and lifestyle factors.

### **Risk factors**
Characteristics, conditions, or behaviors that increase the probability of developing a disease. Can be modifiable (lifestyle, environmental) or non-modifiable (age, genetics, sex). Multiple risk factors often interact to influence disease susceptibility.

### **Biomarkers**
Measurable biological indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to therapeutic interventions. Used for diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression, and assessing treatment efficacy.

### **Phenotype**
Observable characteristics or traits resulting from the interaction between genetics and environment. In disease context, refers to clinical manifestations, symptoms, disease severity, and progression patterns.

## **NEUROBIOLOGY FUNDAMENTALS**

### **Neurons**
Specialized cells of the nervous system that transmit electrical and chemical signals. Composed of cell body (soma), dendrites (receive signals), and axons (transmit signals). Different types include motor neurons, sensory neurons, and interneurons.

### **Central nervous system (CNS)**
The brain and spinal cord, which integrate and process information from the peripheral nervous system. Protected by the blood-brain barrier and cerebrospinal fluid. Site of higher cognitive functions and motor control.

### **Peripheral nervous system (PNS)**
All nervous tissue outside the brain and spinal cord, including nerves, ganglia, and sensory receptors. Divided into somatic (voluntary movements) and autonomic (involuntary functions) nervous systems.

### **Synapses**
Specialized junctions between neurons where electrical or chemical signals are transmitted. Chemical synapses use neurotransmitters to communicate across synaptic clefts, while electrical synapses allow direct current flow.

### **Neurotransmitters**
Chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses between neurons. Examples include dopamine (movement, reward), serotonin (mood), acetylcholine (memory, muscle control), and GABA (inhibitory signaling). Imbalances are implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

### **Dopamine**
A neurotransmitter crucial for motor control, motivation, and reward processing. Produced primarily in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease causes characteristic motor symptoms, and dopamine replacement therapy is a primary treatment approach.

### **Blood-brain barrier**
A selective barrier formed by tight junctions between endothelial cells in brain capillaries. Protects the brain from toxins and pathogens while allowing passage of essential nutrients. Also limits drug delivery to the brain, complicating neurological disease treatment.

## **CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS**

### **Cell death/Apoptosis**
**Apoptosis** is programmed cell death, a normal process for removing damaged or unnecessary cells. **Necrosis** is uncontrolled cell death due to injury. Both contribute to disease pathogenesis, with excessive apoptosis in neurodegeneration and insufficient apoptosis in cancer.

### **Inflammation**
The body's immune response to harmful stimuli, involving immune cell activation, blood vessel dilation, and release of inflammatory mediators. Acute inflammation is protective, but chronic inflammation contributes to many diseases including neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease.

### **Neuroinflammation**
Inflammation specifically within the central nervous system, involving activation of microglia and astrocytes. Can be triggered by protein aggregates, pathogens, or injury. While initially protective, chronic neuroinflammation contributes to neurodegeneration and is a therapeutic target in diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

### **Oxidative stress**
An imbalance between production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses, leading to cellular damage. Results from normal metabolism but is exacerbated by aging, disease, and environmental toxins. Implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer, and aging.

### **Protein aggregation/misfolding**
The abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins that lose their normal function and form toxic aggregates. Common in neurodegenerative diseases, where specific proteins (amyloid-β, tau, α-synuclein) form characteristic pathological inclusions.

### **Autophagy**
A cellular "housekeeping" process that degrades and recycles damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and other cellular components. Declines with aging and is impaired in many neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to protein accumulation and cellular dysfunction.

## **AGING BIOLOGY**

### **Cellular senescence**
A state of permanent cell cycle arrest triggered by DNA damage, telomere shortening, or oncogene activation. Senescent cells accumulate with aging and secrete inflammatory factors, contributing to tissue dysfunction and age-related diseases.

### **DNA damage**
Alterations to DNA structure caused by endogenous factors (metabolism, replication errors) or exogenous factors (radiation, chemicals). Accumulates with aging as repair mechanisms become less efficient, contributing to cancer, neurodegeneration, and other age-related diseases.

### **Mitochondrial dysfunction**
Impaired function of mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses responsible for energy production. Common in aging and neurodegeneration due to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations, oxidative damage, and defective quality control mechanisms.

## **NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE CATEGORIES**

### **Neurodegeneration**
Progressive loss of structure and function of neurons, leading to cognitive, motor, or behavioral impairments. Characterized by specific protein aggregates, affected brain regions, and clinical symptoms. Major examples include Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases.

### **Age-related diseases**
Diseases whose incidence increases significantly with aging, including neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Result from accumulation of cellular damage, declining repair mechanisms, and age-related changes in gene expression and metabolism.

### **Neuropsychiatric diseases**
Disorders affecting both neurological function and behavior/cognition, including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Often involve neurotransmitter imbalances and have both genetic and environmental components.

## **SPECIFIC NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES**

### **Parkinson's disease**
A progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting movement, caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Characterized by motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor symptoms (cognitive impairment, depression). Associated with α-synuclein protein aggregation in Lewy bodies.

### **Substantia nigra**
A brain region in the midbrain that produces dopamine and is critically involved in motor control. The selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is the hallmark pathology of Parkinson's disease, leading to the characteristic motor symptoms.

### **Lewy bodies**
Abnormal protein aggregates found in neurons, composed primarily of misfolded α-synuclein protein. Characteristic pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. Also contain other proteins like ubiquitin and neurofilaments, and their presence correlates with neuronal dysfunction.

### **Alzheimer's disease**
The most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Neuropathologically defined by amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain. Involves synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, and eventually widespread neuronal death.

### **Tauopathy**
A group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal accumulation of tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles. Includes Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Tau normally stabilizes microtubules but becomes hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in disease.

## **KEY DISEASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS**

### **Alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein)**
A presynaptic protein that regulates vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. In Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies, α-synuclein misfolds and aggregates into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and death.

### **Amyloid-β (Aβ)**
A peptide derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. In Alzheimer's disease, Aβ accumulates in extracellular plaques, triggering neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and tau pathology. Target of many Alzheimer's therapeutic approaches.

### **Tau protein**
A microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes neuronal cytoskeleton. In Alzheimer's and other tauopathies, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting cellular transport and causing neuronal death.

## **THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES**

### **Therapeutic targets**
Biological molecules, pathways, or processes that can be modulated by drugs to treat disease. Identification involves understanding disease mechanisms and finding druggable proteins or pathways that influence disease progression or symptoms.

### **Drug repurposing**
The strategy of finding new therapeutic uses for existing drugs that were originally developed for other conditions. Advantages include known safety profiles and faster development timelines. Common approach in neurodegenerative disease research where new drug development is challenging.

### **Gene therapy**
A therapeutic approach that introduces genetic material into a patient's cells to treat disease. Can involve replacing defective genes, introducing therapeutic genes, or silencing disease-causing genes. Particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases, with approaches including viral vectors, antisense oligonucleotides, and CRISPR-based methods.

### **Clinical trials**
Systematic studies in human participants to test the safety and efficacy of medical interventions. Conducted in phases: Phase I (safety), Phase II (efficacy and optimal dosing), Phase III (comparison with standard treatment), and Phase IV (post-market surveillance).

### **Pharmacokinetics**
The study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) in the body. Determines drug concentrations at target sites over time and influences dosing regimens and therapeutic windows.

### **Pharmacodynamics**
The study of drug effects on biological systems and mechanisms of drug action. Describes the relationship between drug concentration and therapeutic or toxic effects, including receptor binding, signal transduction, and physiological responses.

## **DISEASE PROGRESSION AND MONITORING**

### **Disease progression**
The natural course of disease development and worsening over time. Understanding progression patterns helps predict outcomes, optimize treatment timing, and develop biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

### **Prodromal phase**
The early stage of disease when initial symptoms appear but before full clinical diagnosis can be made. Important for early intervention and prevention strategies, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases where significant neuronal loss occurs before symptom onset.

### **Comorbidity**
The presence of multiple diseases or conditions in the same individual. Common in aging populations and complicates treatment decisions, drug interactions, and disease progression. Understanding comorbidity patterns helps optimize patient care.
